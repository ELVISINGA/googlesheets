Google Sheets R API
---

**googlesheets is going away fairly soon (March 2020)! It is not a good idea to write new code that uses it!**

googlesheets (this package) wraps the Sheets v3 API, which is quite old and is going offline in March 2020. The R package will be of no use then and will presumably be archived on CRAN in due course.

googlesheets4 is a new package that wraps the current Sheets v4 API. It is the successor to the googlesheets package. It is strongly advised to adopt googlesheets4 going forward. See the website for how to install googlesheets4 and to see basic usage:

<https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org>

---

Access and manage Google spreadsheets from R with `googlesheets`. 

Features:

  - Access a spreadsheet by its title, key or URL.
  - Extract data or edit data.
  - Create | delete | rename | copy | upload | download spreadsheets and worksheets.
  - Upload local Excel workbook into a Google Sheet and vice versa.

`googlesheets` is inspired by [gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread), a Google Spreadsheets Python API.

The exuberant prose in this README is inspired by [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop): If you've ever wanted to get data in or out of a Google Spreadsheet from R without jumping through a thousand hoops, welcome home!

### Install googlesheets

The released version is available on CRAN

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("googlesheets")
```

**googlesheets is no longer under active development**, although a full replacement is not on CRAN yet. Development has shifted to:

  * [googledrive](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org), [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=googledrive). This package can handle all "whole file" operations for documents on Google Drive, including Sheets. It can work with Team Drives, it can upload/download entire Sheets (with conversions to/from other formats, such as csv and xlsx), and it can upload new media to an existing Sheet ID.
  * [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org), not yet on CRAN, but a [development version is available on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4). This package wraps the Sheets API v4 and does "Sheets-aware" operations that involve concepts specific to Sheets, such as worksheets and cells. It is the successor to googlesheets.

  * [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/googlesheets-1) for an [rOpenSci Community Call in March 2016](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/9)

### Load googlesheets

`googlesheets` is designed for use with the `%>%` pipe operator and, to a lesser extent, the data-wrangling mentality of [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr). This README uses both, but the examples in the help files emphasize usage with plain vanilla R, if that's how you roll. `googlesheets` uses `dplyr` internally but does not require the user to do so. You can make the `%>%` pipe operator available in your own work by loading [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr) or [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr).

```{r load-package}
library("googlesheets")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))
```

### Function naming convention

To play nicely with tab completion, we use consistent prefixes:

  * `gs_` = all functions in the package.
  * `gs_ws_` = all functions that operate on worksheets or tabs within a spreadsheet.
  * `gd_` = something to do with Google Drive, usually has a `gs_` synonym, might one day migrate to a Drive client.

### Quick demo

Here's how to get a copy of a Gapminder-based Sheet we publish for practicing and follow along. You'll be sent to the browser to authenticate yourself with Google at this point.

```{r copy-gapminder, eval = FALSE}
gs_gap() %>% 
  gs_copy(to = "Gapminder")
## or, if you don't use pipes
gs_copy(gs_gap(), to = "Gapminder")
```

Register a Sheet (in this case, by title):

```{r}
gap <- gs_title("Gapminder")
```

Here's a registered `googlesheet` object:

```{r}
gap
```

Visit a registered `googlesheet` in the browser:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gap %>% gs_browse()
gap %>% gs_browse(ws = "Europe")
```

Read all the data in a worksheet:

```{r}
africa <- gs_read(gap)
glimpse(africa)
africa
```

Some of the many ways to target specific cells:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gap %>% gs_read(ws = 2, range = "A1:D8")
gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Europe", range = cell_rows(1:4))
gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Africa", range = cell_cols(1:4))
```

Full `readr`-style control of data ingest -- highly artificial example!

```{r}
gap %>%
  gs_read(ws = "Oceania", col_names = paste0("Z", 1:6),
          na = c("1962", "1977"), col_types = "cccccc", skip = 1, n_max = 7)
```

Create a new Sheet from an R object:

```{r}
iris_ss <- gs_new("iris", input = head(iris, 3), trim = TRUE)
```

Edit some arbitrary cells and append a row:

```{r}
iris_ss <- iris_ss %>% 
  gs_edit_cells(input = c("what", "is", "a", "sepal", "anyway?"),
                anchor = "A2", byrow = TRUE)
iris_ss <- iris_ss %>% 
  gs_add_row(input = c("sepals", "support", "the", "petals", "!!"))
```

Look at what we have wrought:

```{r}
iris_ss %>% 
  gs_read()
```

Download this precious thing as csv (other formats are possible):

```{r}
iris_ss %>% 
  gs_download(to = "iris-ish-stuff.csv", overwrite = TRUE)
```

Download this precious thing as an Excel workbook (other formats are possible):

```{r}
iris_ss %>% 
  gs_download(to = "iris-ish-stuff.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```

Upload a Excel workbook into a new Sheet:

```{r}
gap_xlsx <- gs_upload(system.file("mini-gap", "mini-gap.xlsx",
                                  package = "googlesheets"))
```

Clean up our mess locally and on Google Drive:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gs_vecdel(c("iris", "Gapminder"))
file.remove(c("iris-ish-stuff.csv", "iris-ish-stuff.xlsx"))
```

```{r include = FALSE}
gs_delete(iris_ss)
file.remove(c("iris-ish-stuff.csv", "iris-ish-stuff.xlsx"))
```

Remember, [the vignette](https://rawgit.com/jennybc/googlesheets/master/vignettes/basic-usage.html) shows a lot more usage.

### What the hell do I do with this?

Think of `googlesheets` as a read/write CMS that you (or your less R-obsessed friends) can edit through Google Docs, as well via R. It's like Christmas up in here.

Use a [Google Form](http://www.google.com/forms/about/) to conduct a survey, which populates a Google Sheet.

  * The `googleformr` package provides an R API for Google Forms, allowing useRs to POST data securely to Google Forms without authentication. On [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=googleformr) and [GitHub](https://github.com/data-steve/googleformr) (README has lots of info and links to blog posts).

Gather data while you're in the field in a Google Sheet, maybe [with an iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-sheets/id842849113?mt=8) or [an Android device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets&hl=en). Take advantage of [data validation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/139705?hl=en) to limit the crazy on the way in. You do not have to be online to edit a Google Sheet! Work offline via [the Chrome browser](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2375012?hl=en), the [Sheets app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets&hl=en), or the [Sheets app for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-sheets/id842849113?mt=8).

There are various ways to harvest web data directly into a Google Sheet. For example:

  * [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), which stands for "if this, then that", makes it easy to create recipes in which changes in one web service, such as Gmail or Instagram, trigger another action, such as writing to a Google Sheet.
    - Martin Hawksey blog post about [feeding a Google Sheet from IFTTT](https://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/09/ifttt-if-i-do-that-on-insert-social-networkrss-feedother-then-add-row-to-google-spreadsheet/). 
  * `IMPORTXML(), IMPORTHTML(), IMPORTFEED()`: Google Sheets offer functions to populate Sheets based on web data.
    - Aylien.com [blog post](http://blog.aylien.com/sentiment-analysis-of-restaurant-reviews/) on using `=IMPORTXML()` to populate a Google Sheet with restaurant reviews and ratings from TripAdvisor.
    - Martin Hawksey blog post, [Feeding Google Spreadsheets](https://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/10/feeding-google-spreadsheets-exercises-in-import/), shows how to scrape web data into a Google Sheet with no programming.
  * Martin Hawksey offers [TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info), a free Google Sheet template to setup and run automated collection of search results from Twitter.

Use `googlesheets` to get all that data into R.

Use it in a Shiny app! *[Several example apps](inst/shiny-examples) come with the package.*
